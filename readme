what's loadrc?
    I don't know...
    It's my highly customized vim implementation.
    But it's not only an editor. I used it to do everything.

Project history:
    in the begining, I just saved some useful bash script for later re-use.
    I just installed some wonderful vim plugins, and some simple vim configuration.
    gradually, I found I could merge them together.
    and later, I found, I could merge almost everything I need into vim.
    and now, it is everything I think useful, I will try to merge them together seamlessly.
    now, it includes:
        automatic environment setup.
        wonderful git process and script.
            what's the perfect git process? I have my own answer.

bind generic 9 !sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c && echo Copied %(commit) to clipboard"
use this one to re-write the go to git function
vimrc/.vim/bundle/tig-explorer.vim/autoload/tig_explorer.vim:301   let git_dir = findfile('.git', current_file_dir . ';')
